They talking about, don't send him to his daddy.
You just need to go file for child support.
Bye.
Why?
Why?
<name>
<name> what?
<name>
I'm a girl, I think.
I'm just playing.
Hum, I'm supposed to say, black or non-hispanic.
<ts>
Ninety-five.
<ts>
Stone Mountain.
<ts>
<address>
Psh, twenty-one.
Twenty what?
Nah, I don't know nothing else.
Nah, this all I know.
Shut up.
<ts>
Ooh, my daddy was born
in- where my daddy was born at?
My mama was born in Florida. My daddy was born in Decatur.
Atlanta,
one of them.
Think he at Grady back.
Yep.
I have four brothers
and two sisters.
Yes.
Psh,
all of 'em.
But everybody just pretty much got they own thing going on, so. You know when you grow older,
and you just, you know, start
pretty much yeah. Doing your own thing, yeah.
Can't really link up how you used to, but that don't mean we not close.
We just had one in July.
Twenty-sixteen, so.
It might be twenty-
twenty-eighteen, before we have another one.
<cough>
Excuse me.
<ts>
It wasn't as big as I thought it would be.
It was like everybody- It wasn't good timing.
People wasn't-
A lot of people didn't really show up.
But we still enjoyed the people that we did have.
And it was more so the older people. And that's who you wanna see before they check out, you know.
<cough> Ooh, excuse me
I'm
the oldest girl.
And the second oldest
out of them. I only got one big brother. Everybody else younger than me.
And me and him are only seven months.
Then you got <name>, eighteen.
And then I got twins.
They're eleven. Then I got <name>, he's four.
And <name> is only
October, November, December, January, February, March- She's only four months.
Can't really put a name on it, but you know, <name>.
Cause we the closest.
But-
And my big brother, he grew up
with his mom so,
ev- and then the other four
they just so much younger so.
And then personally, me and <name> just always had a bond.
Um,
I feel like she did
because
I don't know. <name>
<name> could get away with murder.
And Zaria-
Zaria conscious is not like mine. I-
I care.
<name> got a I don't give a fuck mindset.
And sometimes I'm like that too,
but
more so her, cause she don't even care.
Um, I'm not really a friend person.
I have so much family, like
we so close. I got one cousin, I got one friend-
And then I got my sister.
Hell yeah.
And they the only ones who stayed down like hey.
Everybody, let's go.
<ts>
Smoke,
workout, eat.
Talk about boys.
?
Just chill.
Sixth grade. At <school>.
Yep.
<ts>
Um,
school was
what-
what you made it at my school. When I went to <school> el- Well <school> middle and high. And I went to <school> elementary and it was like
in the beginning,
it was good. It was a excellent school you know. We was all
cool. And then you got folks moving in from crazy areas. Then you got everybody else. Around my area growing up, venturing out and stuff.
So it's like,
one day you might have-
We might make-
What is it called? The, um,
we might meet all our criterias, or something then the next day,
they want a food fight,
or something like that.
Or,
or the next day you know, you got these gang members quote unquote. Coming in and out of the school. We like, who are y'all? Where'd y'all come from?
That was like seventh grade.
Seventh grade you start having all the ratchetness.
Well,
I always-
Well when I got in high school, I took, um,
AP classes. but throughout middle school,
it was like thirty and
forty kids in a classroom.
It used to be so hot.
But in high school, I only had maybe like,
ten, eleven people in my class.
Sometime- twenty at the most.
Of course the basics. Math, reading and science, social studies.
Then I got, um,
<ts>
biology and AP geometry, and
AP
whoever else.
<ts>
Um,
all those different maths. And then they had of course, biology, chemistry,
physical science and all that, economics.
Mm-hm.
Not middle school, that was like, high school.
Oh no, I had economics like
tenth grade.
Course you can remember math, cause that's your money
<cough>
<cough>
English and
stuff like that. Literature and stuff like that
it-
<cough>
broadens your va- vocabulary and
it
opens your mind to, I guess,
believe and
think. And then of course you got history and stuff.
You got
you know, some history-
well all history really is our history, but then you hear
different aspects and different point of views as you grow older.
And then you eventually get your own mindset. And chemistry and science and stuff like that
I ain't really go for all that cause I got a real weak stomach.
But
everything else was- everything else was pretty cool. Like
real cool.
Yeah. And I had- My major was gonna be nursing.
Like
I switched my major up soon as I took them classes. I'm like, oh, my stomach is
too weak. I was in those classes they was trying to get us to dissect.
I'm like dissect? Only thing I know how to do is gut fish.
Like, they got a pig out here.
Frogs, I hate them.
We got all kind of stuff.
So I just switched to social work.
Cause I do-
<laugh> That's what I do. That's what I get.
Math.
Not just because of money, but just because
that's always been the subject that I could like,
I could understand fast. Like, my grandma and my cousins
they used to pay me
to do they math work.
Like
Oh, yeah. I'm a genius in math. My mama is too like-
My mama was real fire with math.
But I don't even-
My daddy real smart with it too, but he-
he don't know like the
once they added all the letters and all that. that's when you lost him.
Yeah.
But he can add up some numbers in his head in a heartbeat.
What kind of math you thinking?
<cough>
<cough> Oh, that ain't even yours.
<ts>
Right.

And then they start talking about regions and something. And I'm like, what the fuck is a region?
Oh, they just dropped the decimal and subtract it from the- <ts> just like you do regular subtraction.
Mm-hm.

Yeah.
I've been calculating money like that cause at the little job I work,
